-->creating database
CREATE DATABASE record_company;

-->Delteting the database
Drop Database record_company;

-->the database which we are going to work can be done with below command

USE record_company; #where test is our database

-->creating a table
CREATE TABLE test(
    test_column INT
);

-->after creating the table if we want to change anything in the table

ALTER TABLE test

ADD another_column VARCHAR(255);

-->if you want to drop the table 

Drop table test;

-->lets create a band table and insert some values in it

CREATE TABLE band(
    id Int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, #it automatically increases the value of id when the row is increasing

    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL #it should not contain any null values

    PRIMARY KEY(id) # allocating id as primary key

);

-->we wil create another database albums
CREATE TABLE albums(
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    release_year INT, # we will keep it like this because we will insert again
    band_id INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
    # where we are connecting to primary key as id and foreign as band id
    FOREIGN KEY (band_id) REFERENCES bands(id)
)

-->Inserting into bands
INSERT INTO bands (name)
VALUES ('Iron Maider');

INSERT INTO bands (name)
VALUES ('Deuce'), ('Avenged Sevenfold'), ('Ankor');

--> to get the bands table and where * indicates all the columns
SELECT * FROM bands;

# The below gives only first two values of the bands table
SELECT * FROM bands LIMIT 2;

# we need to get only name column from the bands table
SELECT name FROM bands;

# changing the columns name
SELECT id AS 'ID', name AS 'Band Name'
FROM bands;

# ORder by name is used to get in alphabetical order
SELECT * FROM bands ORDER BY name;
# to reverse the order MEANS IN DESCENDING ORDER EITHER NAME OR NUMBERS
SELECT * FROM bands ORDER BY name DESC;
# ASC IS USED FOR ALPHABETICAL ORDER AND IN THE CASE OF NUMBER FROM START WITH 1

# Now insert the values in albums table

INSERT INTO albums(name,release_year, band_id)
VALUES ('The number of the beasts',1985,1),
('power slave', 1984,1),
('nightmare',2018,2),

SELECT * FROM albums;

SELECT name FROM albums;

--> we don't need same names in the table with need unique names in databases(wont allow duplicate names)
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM albums;

-->update partiuclar year or anything in the table by using update
-->below example previosly it was 1985 now it changed to 1982
--> and applicable for id no.1 where the release will be changed to 1982
UPDATE albums
SET release_year = 1982
WHERE id = 1;

-->selecting the values which released before the 2000

SELECT * FROM albums
WHERE release_year < 2000;

-->Selecting the name where like means exactly with particular letters name
-->which ever the words contains er provide me all those
-->we will get er names and band id whith 2
SELECT * FROM albums

-->particular year and particular band id

SELECT * FROM albums

-->between some point of year values we can get
SELECT * FROM albums

-->The below command is  for find the values which is null
WHERE release_year IS NULL;

-->Delete e row in albums table
DELETE FROM albums WHERE id = 5;

-->lets know about joins
-->join bands table with album table
-->where we are going to return bands table id is equal albums table band_id
SELECT * FROM bands
JOIN albums ON bands.id = albums.band_id;

-->INner joins combines the values on left and where it lists first table which is left(bands)
SELECT * FROM bands
INNER JOIN albums ON bands.id = albums.band_id;

-->left join first it will give  matched values and leftover all are the left table means first table left over values,  give values over left hand side
SELECT * FROM bands
LEFT JOIN albums ON bands.id = albums.band_id;

-->Right join first it will give  matched values and leftover all are the right table means first table left over values, give values over right hand side
SELECT * FROM albums
LEFT JOIN bands ON bands.id = albums.band_id;

-->Defination look over some where
-->just practical

-->Aggreate Functions

-->we will get the average of the all release year
SELECT AVG(release_year) FROM albums;

-->to get sum
SELECT SUM(release_year) FROM albums;

-->Group BY
-->we gonna get the for particular column how many records are their The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.
