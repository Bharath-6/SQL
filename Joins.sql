+-------------+----------+
In SQL, employee_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the employees, their salary, and the ID of their manager. Some employees do not have a manager (manager_id is null). 
 

Find the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the Employees table, but the reports still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input:  
Employees table:
+-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
| employee_id | name      | manager_id | salary |
+-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
| 3           | Mila      | 9          | 60301  |

+-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
Output: 
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 11          |

Explanation: 
The employees with a salary less than $30000 are 1 (Kalel) and 11 (Joziah).
Kalel's manager is employee 11, who is still in the company (Joziah).
Joziah's manager is employee 6, who left the company because there is no row for employee 6 as it was deleted."""

id is the primary key (unique value) column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a student.
id is a continuous increment.
 

Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.
